my $HOME = $ENV{'HOME'};

#### General Configuration Options ####

## Add a directory to the lib dirs
#unshift(@libdirs,"$HOME/share/netcomics");

## Add a directory to the html_template dirs
#unshift(@html_theme_dirs, "$HOME/netcomics/Netcomics/HTML/Themes");

## Create downloaded files with the following permissions (default 0644)
#$files_mode = 0644;

## Store comic download status information in one file (-G).
## This is helpful for managing a directory that holds many comics,
## potentially speeding up netcomics' startup time.
#$single_rli_file = 1;

## The name of the template you wish to use.
#$html_theme = "Default";

## Change the download directory location
#$comics_dir = "$HOME/comics";

## Place different comics in their own directories? (default 0)
## (Usefull for archiving)
#$separate_comics = 1;

## Set the verbosity (both either 1 or 0) (default 0 for both)
#$verbose = 1;
#$extra_verbose = 1;

## Delete files in $comics_dir before downloading (default 0)
#$delete_files = 1;

## Select comics to either download or not download.  Use netcomics -l to
## get a list of comic IDs & place them between the parenthesis.  For
## example, this would get only Garfied & User Friendly: qw(gar uf)
#@selected_comics = qw();

## You must uncomment one of the following if you defined @selected_comics
## (both default to 0)
#$user_specified_comics = 1;   #download only those in @selected_comics
#$user_unspecified_comics = 1; #download all but those in @selected_comics

## Specify an http or ftp proxy (default none).
#$proxy_url = "http://myproxy.site.com/";

## number of days of comics to get, going backwards (default 1).
#$days_of_comics = 2;

## number of days prior to today to start at (default 0).
#$days_prior = 1;

## mkgmtime() rules:
## * Don't specify hour, minute, or second.
## * Month is from 0 to 11.
## * Year is two digits (2001 = 01)

## Specify a range--you can select one of them or both. 
#$start_date = mkgmtime(0,0,0,<day>,<month>,<year>);
#$end_date = mkgmtime(0,0,0,<day>,<month>,<year>);

## Specify individual dates of comics to get.
#@dates = (mkgmtime(0,0,0,<day>,<month>,<year>),
#	  mkgmtime(0,0,0,<day>,<month>,<year>)); 

## External command to use to download URLs if you don't have LWP installed
## Case insensitive: %U replaced with the URL; %R referrer address; %P proxy
## When no %P is in this string and a proxy is specified, the command will
## be prepended with "env http_proxy=<proxy> " if $proxy_url is defined.
## If you include '%U', be sure to surround it by single quotes to prevent
## the shell from interpretting any special characters that may be in the
## URL like ampersand (&).
#$external_cmd = 'wget -q -O - --header="Referer: %R"';

## Don't actually download the comics, but print the URLs on stdout, and
## if creating a webpage, use the URLs in place of file names (default 0).
#$dont_download = 1;

## Download color images when possible (default 1)
#$prefer_color = 0;

## Forcibly redownload when set to 1 (default 0)
## When set to 0, netcomics skips downloading a comic strip for dates for
## which it already successfully downloaded.
## When no comics are specified (either with -c or @selected_comics), all
## comics will be forcibly downloaded.  When comics are specified, only
## those specified are forcibly downloaded and those that had failed in
## previous download attempts are retried (unless they've reached the
## retry limit).
#$always_download = 1;

## Maxmium number of retries (default 3)
## If you don't have the download directory cleared out, netcomics will
## pick up information on comics it's tried to download previously.  Set
## this to 1 if you don't want netcomics to retry to download comics
## you don't specify for it to download.  Set it to 0 for an infinite
## number of retries.
#$max_attempts = 1;

## Supress the final error message that prints out the command to rerun
## (Default is 0: not suppressed)
#$suppress_rerun_command = 1;

#### Webpage Creation Options ####

## Create a set of webpages? (default 0)
#$make_webpage = 1; 

## Create webpages to also include existing downloaded comics in $comics_dir?
## Doesn't make sense to set this to 1 and $delete_files to 1 (default 0).
#$remake_webpage = 1;

## Print the created webpage to stdout.
#$webpage_on_stdout = 0;

## Skip bad comics when creating the webpage
#$skip_bad_comics = 1;

## Order the comics in the webpage by date instead of alphabetically
#$sort_by_date = 1;

## Title of each page generated.  Below is the default
#$webpage_title = "Today's Comics From The Web on <DATE>";

## Date format used to replace <DATE> in webpage template content,
## like the title.  Default is "%b %d, %Y".  The following would change
## it to your "locale's appropriate date representation", according to
## the strftime manpage.
#$webpage_datefmt = "%x";

## Maximum number of comics per webpage. Default is undef (none).
#$comics_per_page = 10;

## Maximum number of index entries per webpage. Default is undef (none).
#$comics_per_index_page = 100;

## HTML <BODY> attribute for the color of the unvisited links in the webpage
#$link_color = "LINK=#9999FF";

## HTML <BODY> attribute for the color of the visited links in the webpage
#$vlink_color = "VLINK=#FF99FF";

## HTML <BODY> attribute for the background of the webpages
#$background = "";

## Create an index for the webpages. Default is 1 (on)
#$webpage_index = 0;

## Title of the index page. %s is replaced with the webpage title.
## Below is the default.
#$webpage_index_title = "Index for %s";

## HTML <BODY> attribute for the color of the unvisited links in the title page
#$index_link_color = "";

## HTML <BODY> attribute for the color of the visited links in the title page
#$index_vlink_color = "";

## Name of the generated files for the webpages. "<NUM>" is replaced with the
## sequence number of the page (if $comics_per_page is set).
#$webpage_filename_tmpl = "comics<NUM>.html";

## Name of the gnerated indexies for the webpages. "<NUM>" is replaced with
## the page number, as with $webpage_filename_tmpl.
#$webpage_indexname_tmpl = "index<NUM>.html";

## Create the webpages with embedded images linked using full pathnames (1)
## instead of relative (0; which is the default).
#$webpage_absolute_paths = 1;

#### Configure Individual and Groups of Comics ####

## Comic-specific options
#$comic{"nickname"} = {
#    'dir' => "fulldirname",
#    'title' => "full name (with blanks, even)",
#    'date_fmt' => "%Y%m%d"
#};
#$comic{"nickname"} = {
#    'alias' => "user-alias",
#    'days_ago' => 14,
#    'size' => [400,300],
#    'author' => "Bartman",
#    'type' => "jpg" #convert "jpeg" to "jpg"
#};


## Options for specifying groups of comics is not currently implemented
#$group{"editorials"} = [qw(bla foo bat bar)];
#$group{"single_panes"} = [qw(boffo fw fdcotd curios)];
#$group{"animated"} = [qw(doodie)];

#$comic{"groupname"} = {
#^^^^^ $comic, not $group
#    'dir' => "fulldirname",
#    'date_fmt' => "%Y%m%d"
#};
#
#And/Or perhaps:
#
#$group{"groupname"} = {
#    'comics' => [qw(com1 com2 com3)],
#    'dir' => "fulldirname",
#    'date_fmt' => "%Y%m%d"
#};

my $HOME = $ENV{'HOME'};

#### General Configuration Options ####

## Add a directory to the lib dirs
#unshift(@libdirs,"$HOME/share/netcomics");

## Create downloaded files with the following permissions (default 0644)
#$files_mode = 0644;

## Change the location of the html template directory
#$html_tmpl_dir = "$HOME/share/netcomics/html_tmpl";

## Change the download directory location (default /var/spool/netcomics)
#$comics_dir = "$HOME/comics";

## Set the verbosity (both either 1 or 0) (default 0 for both)
#$verbose = 1;
#$extra_verbose = 1;

## Delete files in $comics_dir before downloading (default 0)
#$delete_files = 1;

## Select comics to either download or not download
#@selected_comics = (qw());

## You must uncomment one of the following if you defined @selected_comics
## (both default to 0)
#$user_specified_comics = 1;   #download only those in @selected_comics
#$user_unspecified_comics = 1; #download all but those in @selected_comics

## Specify an http or ftp proxy (default none).
#$proxy_url = "http://myproxy.site.com/";

## number of days of comics to get, going backwards (default 1).
#$days_of_comics = 2;

## number of days prior to today to start at (default 0).
#$days_prior = 1;

## mkgmtime() rules:
## * Don't specify hour, minute, or second.
## * Month is from 0 to 11.
## * Year is two digits (2001 = 01)

## Specify a range--you can select one of them or both. 
#$start_date = mkgmtime(0,0,0,<day>,<month>,<year>);
#$end_date = mkgmtime(0,0,0,<day>,<month>,<year>);

## Specify individual dates of comics to get.
#@dates = (mkgmtime(0,0,0,<day>,<month>,<year>),
#	  mkgmtime(0,0,0,<day>,<month>,<year>)); 

## External command to use to download URLs if you don't have LWP installed
#$external_cmd = 'wget -q -O - --header="Referer: %R"';

## Don't actually download the comics, but print the URLs on stdout, and
## if creating a webpage, use the URLs in place of file names (default 0).
#$dont_download = 1;

## Download color images when possible (default 1)
#$prefer_color = 0;

## Forcibly redownload when set to 1 (default 0)
## When set to 0, netcomics skips downloading a comic strip for dates for
## which it already successfully downloaded.
## When no comics are specified (either with -c or @selected_comics), all
## comics will be forcibly downloaded.  When comics are specified, only
## those specified are forcibly downloaded and those that had failed in
## previous download attempts are retried (unless they've reached the
## retry limit).
#$always_download = 1;

## Maxmium number of retries (default 3)
## If you don't have the download directory cleared out, netcomics will
## pick up information on comics it's tried to download previously.  Set
## this to 1 if you don't want netcomics to retry to download comics
## you don't specify for it to download.  Set it to 0 for an infinite
## number of retries.
#$max_attempts = 1;


#### Webpage Creation Options ####

## Create a set of webpages? (default 0)
#$make_webpage = 1;

## Print the created webpage to stdout.
#$webpage_on_stdout = 0;

## Skip bad comics when creating the webpage
#$skip_bad_comics = 1;

## Order the comics in the webpage by date instead of alphabetically
#$sort_by_date = 1;

## Title of each page generated.  Below is the default
#$webpage_title = "Today's Comics From The Web on <DATE>";

## Maximum number of comics per webpage. Default is undef (none).
#$comics_per_page = 10;

## HTML <BODY> attribute for the color of the unvisited links in the webpage
#$link_color = "LINK=#9999FF";

#$vlink_color = "VLINK=#FF99FF";

#$index_link_color = "";

## HTML <BODY> attribute for the color of the visited links in the title page
#$index_vlink_color = "";

#$webpage_index_filename = "index.html";


#### Configure Individual and Groups of Comics ####

## Comic-specific options
#$comic{"nickname"} = {
#    'dir' => "fulldirname",
#    'title' => "full name (with blanks, even)",
#    'date_fmt' => "%Y%m%d"
#};
#$comic{"nickname"} = {
#    'alias' => "user-alias",
#    'days_ago' => 14,
#    'size' => [400,300],
#    'author' => "Bartman",
#    'type' => "jpg" #convert "jpeg" to "jpg"
#};


## Options for specifying groups of comics is not currently implemented
#$group{"editorials"} = [qw(bla foo bat bar)];
#$group{"single_panes"} = [qw(boffo fw fdcotd curios)];
#$group{"animated"} = [qw(doodie)];

#$comic{"groupname"} = {
#^^^^^ $comic, not $group
#    'dir' => "fulldirname",
#    'date_fmt' => "%Y%m%d"
#};
#
#And/Or perhaps:
#
#$group{"groupname"} = {
#    'comics' => [qw(com1 com2 com3)],
#    'dir' => "fulldirname",
#    'date_fmt' => "%Y%m%d"
#};

* Webpage Creation Features

** Include icon links in webpages.

** Add web page creation option to specify order of comics in web pages.
(partially done with -L)

** Separate file element out of body element template. 
Have 2 templates for the body elements--a template wrapper around a
set of file element templates, and a file element template.

** Include banner ads with comics

----------------------------------------------------------------------

* Comic Modules

** Finish each of the disabled modules.

** Add Mosquito Creek: http://frontpage.pangea.ca/jrobbins/

** Add Fat Boy and Little Man: http://www.fatboyandlittleman.com/

** Add Mother Goose & Grimm

** Change comicspages_ed to use a 'func' to determine what comics to download.
Should probably base it off of penny_arcade.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------

* Globalization

** Add timezone adjustment logic & include general TZ for each rli.

** Localize documentation

** Internationalize & localize software, including html templates

-----------------------------------------------------------------------

* Displaying Comics

** Find a program that can display animated gifs.

** Find screen savers that can show the comics.

** Update show_comics to use the Tk image command to display comics
If jpeg can't be displayed with that command, resort to something else.

** Update show_comics to allow specifying the command to use
For example, make it so that they can have their background set to
that image.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------

* Distribution & Build Environment

** Create an icon for netcomics.

** Change Makefile to use automake and autoconf.

** Provide a way to automatically download updates to the modules.

** Remove dependency of the main rpm on the modules rpm.

** Separate modules into their own debian package.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------

* General Features

** Support multi-file sizes.

** Add an option to specify the umask of the files created.

** Add mechanism to add support for downloading categories of comics.

** Add an option to specify the number of retries to get a comic:
-r <# of retries>

** Support randomly released comics.
In other words, make it so that comics that do not adhere to a time
schedule for released can be downloaded intuitively.  This includes:
http://www.kaniamania.com/
http://www.gibbleguts.com/
http://www.nic.com/~cheah/limpid.html (Limpidity)

** Create a CGI script that would produce webpages on the fly.

** Add a GUI for configuring netcomics & possibly displaying comics

** Add a daemonized mode

** Add a way to more flexibly define the name to give to files.

** Optimize netcomics so same URL doesn't get downloaded many times.
Perhaps add a field called static that would list the names of the
other fields that never change.

** Add support for set names.

** Add option to get a whole archive of comics.

** Add ability to specify a set of dates per comic.

** Add sort by author option & list author names in -l output.

** Add advertisement download feature

** Include ability to download banner ads

** Restructure modules so that non-RLI fields don't have to be accessed
through running the function.

** Add capability for user to override days behind info in rc file.

** Output an error message saying that modules package wasn't installed
or the module directory path is wrong if no modules are found.

** Have netcomics create persistent info files for each comic downloaded.
These files would include info like author, caption, download status,
URLs (main, archives, remote version of comic strip), etc.  Then, add
support to webpage creation to utilize this info when recreating
webpages.  The webpage creation could also then be put into another
script, with the infrastructure for reading persistent info files put
into a perl module.  This would also make it so that netcomics could
better work in a daemon mode where it can continually monitor comic
strips that haven't yet successfully downloaded.

** Filetype from final URL
Add option for modules to utilize that instructs netcomics to derive
the filetype from the URL used to download the image.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------

* Bugs

** Fix bug from Archimede on 12/14/99

** From Chris McAvaney: When I get netcomics to re-create the html pages,
it puts the newer formated gif files in the comics1.html file and not
the last file.  So the sorting routine must be doing something a bit
wierd.

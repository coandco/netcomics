----------------------------------------------------------------------

* Webpage Creation Features

** Include icon links in webpages.

** Add web page creation option to specify order of comics in web pages.
(partially done with -L)

** Separate file element out of body element template. 
Have 2 templates for the body elements--a template wrapper around a
set of file element templates, and a file element template.

** Include banner ads with comics

** Use image size even if specified
This means that the only time when the file size is used is when the
image couldn't be downloaded.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

* Comic Modules

** Finish each of the disabled modules.

** Add Fat Boy and Little Man: http://www.fatboyandlittleman.com/

** Add Mother Goose & Grimm

** Change comicspages_ed to use a 'func' to determine what comics to download.
Should probably base it off of penny_arcade.

** Add limpidity (releases by number, but what's change page has some dates)n
http://www.furcrazy.com/limpidity/

-----------------------------------------------------------------------

* Globalization

** Add timezone adjustment logic & include general TZ for each rli.

** Localize documentation

** Internationalize & localize software, including html templates

-----------------------------------------------------------------------

* Displaying Comics

** Find a program that can display animated gifs.

** Find screen savers that can show the comics.

** Update show_comics to use the Tk image command to display comics
If jpeg can't be displayed with that command, resort to something else.

** Update show_comics to allow specifying the command to use
For example, make it so that they can have their background set to
that image.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------

* Distribution & Build Environment

** Create an icon for netcomics.

** Change Makefile to use automake and autoconf.

** Provide a way to automatically download updates to the modules.
This should probably use CVS revision IDs.

** Remove dependency of the main rpm on the modules rpm.

** Separate modules into their own debian package.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------

* General Features

** Support multi-file sizes.

** Add an option to specify the umask of the files created.

** Add mechanism to add support for downloading categories of comics.

** Create a CGI script that would produce webpages on the fly.

** Add a GUI for configuring netcomics & possibly displaying comics

** Add a daemonized mode

** Add a way to more flexibly define the name to give to files.

** Optimize netcomics so same URL doesn't get downloaded many times.
Perhaps add a field called static that would list the names of the
other fields that never change.

** Add support for set names.

** Add option to get a whole archive of comics.

** Add ability to specify a set of dates per comic.

** Add sort by author option & list author names in -l output.

** Add advertisement download feature

** Include ability to download banner ads

** Restructure modules so that non-RLI fields don't have to be accessed
through running the function.

** Add capability for user to override days behind info in rc file.

** Output an error message saying that modules package wasn't installed
or the module directory path is wrong if no modules are found.

** Separate webpage creation into its own module 
The webpage creation could be put into another script, with the
infrastructure for reading persistent info files put into a perl
module.  This would also make it so that netcomics could better work
in a daemon mode where it can continually monitor comic strips that
haven't yet successfully downloaded.

** Filetype from final URL
Add option for modules to utilize that instructs netcomics to derive
the filetype from the URL used to download the image.

** GnomeTransferManager & FreeNet
Consider utilizing or extending GnomeTransferManager to download files
http://gtm.sourceforge.net/
And consider tapping into freenet to distribute images
http://freenet.sourceforge.net/

** Ability to specify a referer for individual URLs
The current scheme allows a module to specify a referer, but the same
one is used for all HTTP requests generated to download its image.  It
is possible that a website would setup a scheme that requires a
different referer for the webpage that contains the IMG SRC for the
image.  Design proposal: utilize 'referer' in @exprs each time (which
means that the last entry in a referer list in @exprs wouldn't be used
and that the global 'referer' would have to be set for the first page
downloaded.  Something else would have to be devised for functions
that return a list of relative URLs that might need different referers
(although highly unlikely this functionality would be needed).

** Download statistics
It would be nice to have netcomics keep statistics on download
failures over time so that netcomics' maintainer could setup a scheme
where those statistics are monitored and if too high a percentage of
failures are occurring, it will shoot the maintainer for not doing
his/her job! (-;

** Keywords/Categories
Add a field that would contain a list of keywords or categories then
that could be utilized to select a group of comics.

** Limit -u, the "don't download, but use URLs" option to not work on refers
This option makes the output webpage contain URLs to the comics at the
website on which they're published.  For those comics that require a
specific referer, this doesn't work.  Although it would be nice to
find someway to tell the browser to fake the referer for specific
images, I don't think that's possible.  Therefore, this option should
be enhanced so that it downloads the *minimum* number of comics
possible: those that require a referer, while simply generating URLs for
those that don't.

One reason for using -u is to not actually store copyrighted
material (but to let the webbrowser's cache do that just as if the
user were browsing the comic's website).  Since a system like freenet
is designed from the ground up to address this issue, perhaps
utilization of it would be good technical solution to the referer
problem.

** Username & password authentication mechanisms for websites

** Option to prevent status files from being loaded.

** Option to delete only those comics & status files that were successful
or were unsuccessful and reached the maximum retry limit.

** Add a signal catcher 
if Crl-C'd during download, it would stop and then go to webpage creation.

** Better file type handling
Allow multiple-file-comics to have different types (sketch, eg: 20001211).
Use file command to determine image type.
Else, look for filetype in the url.

** Option & API for selecting the file type.
Source Wars provides comics in png and gif.  Like color, should be
able to let the user choose which one to grab.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------

* Bugs

** Fix bug from Archimede on 12/14/99

** From Chris McAvaney: When I get netcomics to re-create the html pages,
it puts the newer formated gif files in the comics1.html file and not
the last file.  So the sorting routine must be doing something a bit
weird.

** Fix bug where RLIs loaded from files have 'name' which is deprecated.

** Fix the don't download specifier (-C)

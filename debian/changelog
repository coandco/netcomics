netcomics (0.13-1) unstable; urgency=medium

  * Each comics strip's Resource Locator Info (RLI) structure is now
    saved persistently in the spool directory when the comic strip is
    downloaded.  These "rli status files" are reloaded during the next
    invocation of netcomics (unless they're purged) and used to
    determine what comics needs to be retried to be downloaded.  When
    the webpage is recreated, the status files are used to find out
    extra information about the already downloaded comics (author,
    caption, website URLs, etc).  New commandline options: -R -a -q.
  * Referers are now handled.  A module may specify its own referer if
    the default (derived from the URL) is not correct.
  * The external command specified may now include several macros which
    get replaced.  See the manpage for details.

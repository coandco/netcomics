To install, type:

  make install

Files are installed under /usr by default, and a download directory
(where comic files are placed & the webpages are generated) is created
at /var/spool/netcomics by default.

If you want to change where perl is, the base prefix to install under,
or the default download directory, then you can either change their
definitions in the Makefile or you can specify them on the command
line when you install:

  make install PREFIX=/usr/local TMPBASE=/home/httpd/html \
	PERL=/usr/local/bin/perl PERLTK=/usr/local/bin/perl

Note that doing this will cause documentation to be recreated also.

If you want an rpm, type:

  make rpm
  rpm -Uvh /usr/src/redhat/RPMS/noarch/netcomics-<version>.noarch.rpm

You can also set any Makefile variables on the commandline (like
PREFIX, TMPBASE), and they should get updated in the installed RPM
spec properly.

See the netcomics manpage for examples and instructions on how to use
it.

Use show_comics to have a selected list of comics in a ~/.comics files
to be shown during the day.  show_comics will run in the background
and show comics throughout the day, the time inbetween comics
calculated from the time you plan to leave.  See its manpage for more
details. 

Take a look at the display_comics script, and modify it to your liking
if you want to use it.  You don't have to use it if you want to setup
your own way of having the comics displayed each day for everyone on
your network, or if you plan on just using automatically generated
webpage (options -w & -W).

Also take a look at the scripts under the contrib directory.

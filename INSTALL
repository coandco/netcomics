To install, type:

  perl Makefile.PL
  make
  make install    

Files are installed under the library path of the perl you used to
generate the Makefile.  The download directory (where comic files are
placed & the webpages are generated) is /var/spool/netcomics by default.

Take a look a the install_home target in the Makefile to change where
files are installed.

If you want an rpm, type:

  make rpm
  rpm -Uvh /usr/src/redhat/RPMS/noarch/netcomics-<version>.noarch.rpm

Note that the rpm spec is very specify to perl being installed under a
prefix of /usr.

See the netcomics & comicpage manpages for examples and instructions
on how to use them.

Use show_comics to have a selected list of comics in a ~/.comics files
to be shown during the day.  show_comics will run in the background
and show comics throughout the day, the time inbetween comics
calculated from the time you plan to leave.  See its manpage for more
details. 

Take a look at the display_comics script, and modify it to your liking
if you want to use it.  You don't have to use it if you want to setup
your own way of having the comics displayed each day for everyone on
your network, or if you plan on just using automatically generated
webpage (options -w & -W).

Also take a look at the scripts under the contrib directory.

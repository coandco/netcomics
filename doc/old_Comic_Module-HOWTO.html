<H1>How to Write Your Own Comic Strip Resource Locator Module (Old Way)</H1>
<P>The following applies to any version of netcomics, including the
current one because of backwards-compatibility.  However, Starting
with version 0.5, it is recommended you use the
<A HREF="Comic_Module-HOWTO.html">new version</A>.</P>

<H2>RLI: Resource Locator Information</H2>
<P>
The following table describes the <B>RLI</B> hash structure.
<TABLE BORDER WIDTH=100%>
  <TR>
    <TH>Field</TH>
    <TH>Format</TH>
    <TH>Example</TH>
    <TH>Description</TH>
  </TR>

  <TR>
    <TD>name</TD>
    <TD>Full_Name-<BR>YYMMDD.filetype</TD>
    <TD>strftime("My_Comic-<BR>%y%m%d.gif",@ltime)</TD>
    <TD>The name of the file the comic is to be saved as.  There isn't
	much flexibility here with what you can do, because this field
	is used to obtain several key pieces of information.  When the
	-l option is given to netcomics, it will take this field from
	every RLI, and strip away the date & file extension, and
	remove any underscores to create the name of the comic.  This
	same thing is performed for webpage creation, too.
    </TD>
  </TR>
  <TR>
    <TD>base</TD>
    <TD>URL</TD>
    <TD>http://www.company.com/</TD>
    <TD>This should be the part of the URL that is common between the
	page's URL and the comic's URL.  Typically, this is just the
	main URL for the website.
    </TD>
  </TR>
  <TR>
    <TD>page</TD>
    <TD>part of a<BR>URL or undef</TD>
    <TD>strftime(archives/mycomic-<BR>%y%m%d.html",@ltime)</TD>
    <TD>This field is either set to <I>undef</I>, or completes the URL
	when appended to <B>base</B> for the HTML page that contains
	a link to the comic.  When set to <I>undef</I>, the next
	field, <B>expr</B>, is <U>not</U> used as a regular
	expression, but instead is appended to <B>base</B> as-is to
	complete the URL used to obtain the comic strip.</TD>
  </TR>
  <TR>
    <TD>expr</TD>
    <TD>regular expression<BR>or part of a URL</TD>
    <TD>(comics/mycomic-\\d+.gif)</TD>
    <TD>This field is either a regular expression used to find the
	last part of the URL for the comic, or is the last part
	of the URL for the comic itself.  When the <B>page</B> field
	is left undefined, this field will not be used as a regular
	expression, but will be appended to <B>base</B>, as-is to
	complete the URL used to obtain the comic strip.  When
	<B>page</B> is defined, this field is used to match on some
	text in the page downloaded by the URL made up of <B>base</B>
	and <B>page</B>.  When used as a regular expression, it is
	<U>required</U> that a pair of parenthesis is left around the
	part of the text being matched on to be used as the completing
	part of the URL to obtain the comic strip.  There only needs
	to be one set of parenthesis.  If more than one pair exists,
	only the one that causes $1 to be defined in the perl code
	will be used (IOW, nothing fancy here.  netcomics doesn't have
	any special logic, and is coded to only deal with $1).
  </TR>
  
</TABLE>
      
</P>
<H2>@lof: List of Functions</H2>
<P>
The global @lof list variable contains the names of all of the
functions that return RLI hashes.  Add your function's name to this
list with the code:
<PRE>
push(@lof,"myfunction");
</PRE>
If you have more than one function to add, use write code like this:
<PRE>
push(@lof,("myfunction1","myfunction2"));
</PRE>
</P>
<H2>Creating a Module File</H2>
<P>
An RLI function takes one argument: the time as returned by time().
Your function should expect this to be today's time, so if the website
you're getting a comic from, names its comics files with dates, you
can use the time given to your function by subtracting from it the
number of seconds prior to today the comic is.  So, if the comics
posted on the website are one week old, subtract from the argument
given to your function (7*24*60*60).  That is, the number of seconds
in one week. You can then use the standard POSIX functions to produce
strings from the time you calculated.  Here's an example:
</P>
<PRE>
push(@lof,"uf");

#UserFriendly http://www.userfriendly.org/cartoons/
sub uf {
    my @ltime = gmtime(shift(@_));
    my $rec = {
        'name' => strftime("User_Friendly-%y%m%d.gif",@ltime),
        'base' => "http://www.userfriendly.org",
        'page' => lc strftime("/cartoons/archives/%y%b/%Y%m%d.html",
                              @ltime),
        'expr' => lc strftime("(\/cartoons\/archives\/%y%b\/uf\\d+\.gif)",
                              @ltime)
        };
    return $rec;
}
</PRE>
<P>Note that the perl function, lc() (lower case) is also used to
help produce the proper string.</P>

<P>Your function should then return the RLI (as a reference, not as
the hash itself), and it will be used by netcomics.  Put the function
in a file that is readible to all users in /usr/lib/netcomics, and
<I>netcomics</I> will find it and use it without any modification to
its own code.
</P>

<H1>How to Write Your Own Comic Strip Resource Locator Module</H1>
<P>The following applies to netcomics version 0.10 & higher.  The
'func' field is new for version 0.6. The 'name' field has been done
away with, but netcomics will still use it and makes it possible for
you to not have to supply a 'title' and 'type', but that's not
recommended for maintaince purposes. Although not recommended, you may
still use <A HREF="old_Comic_Module-HOWTO.html">the old way</A>
(versions 0.1 to 0.4) because I've kept netcomics as backwards
compatible as possible.</P>

<H2>RLI: Resource Locator Information</H2>

    <TD>This field is completes the URL	when appended to <B>base</B>
	for the comic, or an HTML page that contains a link to another
	URL used to get the comic.  When it points to the comic
	itself, the field, <B>exprs</B>, is set to undef, or is not
	specified at all. When it points to a document containing some
	other reference that can be used to locate the comic, the

    <TD><P>This field is an array of regular expressions used to find the
	last part of the URL for the comic. Once a starting web page
	has been downloaded using the concatenation of <B>base</B> and
	<B>page</B>, the elements of the array are used, one by one,
	to match on some text in the page downloaded.  The last
	regular expression in the array is used as the one to create a
	URL to download the comic itself.</P>
	<P>Each element of the array is a regular expression. It is
	<U>required</U> that a pair of parenthesis is left around the
	part of the text being matched on to be used as the completing
	part of the next URL to obtain the comic strip or another
	web page containing another reference to be matched on. There
	only needs to be one set of parenthesis in each regular
	expression.  If more than one pair exists, only the one that
	causes $1 to be defined in the perl code will be used (IOW,
	nothing fancy here.  netcomics doesn't have any special logic,
	and is coded to only deal with $1).</P>

    <TD><P>This field provides the ability for multiple files to be
	downloaded from a website for a single comic.  The last field
	of the RLI to be used, this function pointed to by the
	subroutine reference is run, being given the text of the
	last web page downloaded, if there was one.  The function
	should return a list of strings:  each string being a relative
	URL, that is finally used to download a comic file.  The
	function may also return in the list a reference to a hash,
	like with the field 'exprs', which contains fields & values to
	be added to RLI.</P>
	<P>Most often, the function will be created by a module as a
	closure.  A closure is an anonymous subroutine that is created
	with some specific data.  For example, if you're writing a
	closure that is to return two relative URLs, each with some
	text in it that is created from the date, the data you need to
	embed in the subroutine when you create it needs to be the
	date given to the RLI function in some form.</P>
	<P>Usually, a hash reference would be put in the returned list
	to provide a caption that would be put in the generated
	webpage below the comic.  See penny_arcade for an example.</P>
	<P>See the module files madam-n-eve, sluggy_freelance, doodie,
	and goats for some examples.  This was introduced in version
	0.6.</P>

	the file cannot be determined (Image::Size not installed,
	the system's file command doesn't report the image file's
	dimensions, or it was specified to not download the comics),
	then this array (width,height), is used.  If not provided,
	and the comics's image size cannot be determined, then the
	created webpage will not include the dimensions of the file,
	and therefore the webpage will not load as quickly depending
	on the web browser.</P>

	hash returned by this function will then be used to try
	and download the comic again.  Be careful to not create the

</TABLE>
      
</P>
<H2>%hof: Hash of Functions</H2>
<P>
The global %hof hash (associative array) contains the names of all of
the functions that return RLI hashes, and the number of days in the
past the comic is available using the RLI returned. The keys are the
names of the functions, and the values are the numbers of days.</P>

Add your function's name to this hash with code like this:
<PRE>
$hof{"myfunction"} = 0;
</PRE>
That example is for a comic whose latest strip is available on the
same day. If you have many functions in one module file to add to
%hof, use code like this:
<PRE>
foreach (qw(f1 f2 f3 f4)) {
    $hof{$_} = 7;
}
</PRE>
In that example, every function returns RLI's whose comics they
retrieve are available a week after they're published.
</P>
<H2>Creating a Module File</H2>
<P>
An RLI function takes one argument: the time as returned by time().
Your function should expect this to be the exact time that it is
supposed to use to determine the date of the comic to retrieve.
It is easiest to use the POSIX time functions to create strings using
the time given.  Here's an example:
</P>
<PRE>
#-*-Perl-*-

#Add the name of the subroutines to the hash of functions
#with the number of days from today the comic is available
$hof{"uf"} = 0;

#UserFriendly http://www.userfriendly.org/cartoons/
sub uf {
    my ($time,$color) = @_;
    return undef if $time &lt; 879724800; #1st comic: Nov 17, 1997
    my @ltime = gmtime($time);
    my @monthconv = ("jan", "feb", "mar", "apr", "may", "jun",
                     "jul", "aug", "sep", "oct", "nov", "dec");
    my $b = $monthconv[$ltime[4]];

    my $rec = {
	'title' => "User Friendly",
	'author' => "Illiad",
	'type' => 'gif',
	'main' => "http://www.userfriendly.org/static/",
	'archives' => "http://www.userfriendly.org/cartoons/archives/",
	'base' => "http://www.userfriendly.org",
	'page' => strftime("/cartoons/archives/%y$b/%Y%m%d.html",
			   @ltime),
	'exprs' => [strftime("(\\/cartoons\\/archives\\/%y$b\\/(uf)?\\d+\\.gif)",
			     @ltime)],
	'size' => ($ltime[6] == 0 ? [720,529] : [720,274])
	};
    return $rec;
}

1;
</PRE>
<P>The values that are passed to the function are the UTC time value
(number of seconds since 00:00:00, January  1, 1970) as created by
mkgmtime() in netcomics, and whether or not color is preferred. If
your comic strip is available in both b/w and color, then use the
second argument to the function to determine what type to get (1 for
color, 0 for b/w) (see dilbert for an example).</P>

<P>Note that in the above example, the time is checked against a large
integer that is described at being Nov 17, 1997.  Use the mktime
script included in the contrib directory to create this number so you
can easily & quickly test to make sure the requested date is not past
the start of the archives.</P>

<P><B>Do not use localtime()!  Use only gmtime() in a module because a
future enhancement will be to had logic to handle knowing what
timezone the comic is in and what time during the day it is typically
updated.</B> (As far as translating the UTC time to a date is
concerned, both gmtime() and localtime() produce the same results as
long as everything that deals with dates in netcomics works with the
same function.) Do not put any special handling of checking the time in
modules for when the comic is updated during the day.  That special
handling will be added to netcomics later.  If you want to save that
information with as best chance as possible to not have to go back and
edit the module in the future, you can go ahead and add two fields to
your module's RLI structure: 'tz' and 'hour' (see the doodie
module). Those fields won't be utilized right now, but those are what
I think the fields will be when timezone support is added.</P>

<P>Your function should return the RLI (as a reference, not as
the hash itself), and it will be used by netcomics.  Put the function
in a file that is readable to all users in /usr/lib/netcomics, and
<I>netcomics</I> will find it and use it without you needing to make
any modification to its code.  Or you can put it in some other
directory like ~/lib/netcomics and use the -m option on the
commandline with that directory name.</P>

<P>And finally, you must have as the last
line in the file: 
<PRE>
1;
</PRE>
If you don't, the module will not load properly.
</P>

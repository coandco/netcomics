netcomics - retrieve comics from the Internet

=head1 SYNOPSIS

B<netcomics> [B<-bBDhiIlLosuvv>] [B<-c,-C> I<"comic ids">] [B<-p> I<proxy>] [B<-S,-T,-E> I<date>]
                 [B<-n,-N> I<days>] [B<-d,-m,-t> I<dir>] [B<-f> I<date_fmt>] [B<-g> [I<program>]] [B<-nD>]
                 [B<-r> I<rc_file>] [B<-W,-w>[=I<n>]] [B<-nw>]

=head1 DESCRIPTION

The I<netcomics> program will download today's comic strips from
the Web, and place them in a spool directory where they can be
retrieved for display.  Because each website that carries comic
strips chooses how old of strips to show, the comic strips downloaded
will actually be from different dates.  Most common will be comic
strips that are 1 week, 2 weeks, and 3 weeks old. Also, each website
is not updated at the same time, nor are any of them updated at a
consistent time during the day.  Therefore, when running netcomics
as a cron job in the early morning, you may need to rerun it by hand
a little later in the day to get the comics that it couldn't find.
The exact command to run is given at the end of I<netcomics> output
if any failures occurred.

I<netcomics> also supports retrieving specific dates of comics.  A
"Starting Date" may be specified with B<-S>.  An "Ending Date" may be
specified with B<-E>.  And a specific date may be specified with
B<-T>.  All dates are given in the M-D-[YY]YY format.  If a start date
is given without an end date, B<-n> may be used to specify the number
of days of comics to retrieve starting at the specified start date.
If an end date is given without a start date, B<-n> will specify the
number of days of comics to retrieve counting backwards from the end
date.  If a start date is given without B<-n> or B<-E>, then the end
date is assumed to be today's date.  If the option given to B<-E>,
B<-S>, or B<-T> is just an integer, that integer is interpreted as
the number of days prior to the current day (specify specific dates
relatively).

Another way to specify the dates to download comics, is to use B<-N>
in conjunction with B<-n>.  The argument to B<-N> is the number of
days prior to the current day to retrieve comics.  Note that this does
not specify an actual date.  It rather indicates the number of days
ago a comic was made available, rather than the actual date of the
comic.  To see how far behind the date of each comic is from the date
it actually gets released, use B<-l>.  So if today is Wednesday, and you
specify B<-N 2>, I<netcomics> will download the comics that were made
available on Monday.  This is useful for running netcomics in a
timezone that is way ahead of the timezones the comics' websites are
located.

I<netcomics> was created for the purpose of giving your weary mind a 
little relief from your hectic workday, so another script
called I<show_comics> has been provided to periodically popup the 
retrieved comic strips throughout the workday.  Another script called
I<display_comics> has also been provided, but it is only an example
script of what can be done for displaying comics on many users
computers on a network.

B<Important:>  The further east your timezone is from the US, the later 
in the day you'll have to run I<netcomics>.  As a reference, I suggest
those whose timezone in GMT to wait to run the script at 12:30pm if
they want to get all the comics at a time that's pretty likely to have
had all of the websites updated.  Use B<-N> if you want to run the
script early in the morning and are having problems getting comics to
download. Also, just because a comic failed to download doesn't mean
that the module for that comic is broken--it most likely the website
just hasn't been updated yet.

I<netcomics> can also create an HTML file, "index.html", in the
directory you have the comics placed.   If a number is given with
B<-W> or B<-w>, it will be used to determine the number of comics to
be placed in each html file.  Subsequent files are named "comic#.html".

B<Disclaimer:> Do not put the comics up on the Internet!  You should
only use them for your own use.  Also, do not redistribute the comics
downloaded by I<netcomics> in any other way unless you receive written
authorization from each publisher.

days prior to today, with which to define the range of days of comics
to retrieve.  Must be used in combination with one of B<-S> or B<-n>.
The date is of the form: M-D-Y.

=item B<-f> I<date_fmt>

Specify the date format used when naming files.  Default is C<'%y%m%d'>.

=item B<-g> [I<program>]

Specify a program to use to perform HTTP requests.  The URL to retrieve 
is attached to the end of the provided text without a space. The 
program must write the retrieved content of the URL on its stdout.
The default command is:

   'wget -q -O - '.

=item B<-h>

Show usage. Comics will not be downloaded.

=item B<-i>
Don't create an index for the webpages.

=item B<-I>
Create an index for the webpages. Specify this to override the setting 
in the rc file if need be.

=item B<-l>

List supported comics & their identifiers, sorted by name alphabetically.
Comics will not be downloaded.

=item B<-L>

Sort comics in webpages by date and when using B<-l>, by days behind.

=item B<-m> I<dir>

Add dir to the locations of comic modules. Default is /home/benh/share/netcomics.
This option may be repeated to add multiple directories.

=item B<-M> I<dir>

Use only the list of locations of comic modules specified on the command line.

=item B<-n> I<days>

Retrieve this number of days of comics, going backwards. Default is 1.
This option may be used in conjunction with B<-N>.

=item B<-N> I<days>

Start retrieving comics this many days before the currently available date.
If you use B<-l> to show the comic id's, the 3rd column indicates the number
of days behind a comic is available.  By default, if B<-E> or B<-S> are
not specified, then netcomics will retrieve each comic, understanding that
the latest available is that many days ago (according to the number shown
in the 3rd column).  Use this option to push the number of days ago back 
even further.  Default is 0. This option may be used in conjunction with 
B<-n>, but not with B<-S> or B<-E>.

=item B<-o>

Write the webpage on standard out. Cannot specify the number of comics
per page for B<-W> or B<-w> if you use this option.

=item B<-r> I<rc filename>

Specify an alternate name for the user-specific rc file

=item B<-s>

=head1 EXAMPLES

=over 3

=item 1.
Run as a cron job at 7:30am, Monday through Friday, removing
the previous day's comics beforehand, and creating a web page.
And for Monday, also retrieve Saturday & Sunday's comics.

   30 07  *  *  2-5  /home/benh/bin/netcomics -D -w
   30 07  *  *  1    /home/benh/bin/netcomics -n 3 -D -w


=item 2.
Same as before, except, for Monday, get Saturday's & Sunday's
comics, and for Tuesday, get Monday & Tuesday's.  This is so there
isn't such an overload of comics on Monday.

   30 07  *  *  1    /home/benh/bin/netcomics -N 1 -n 2 -D -w
   30 07  *  *  2    /home/benh/bin/netcomics -n 2 -D -w
   30 07  *  *  3-5  /home/benh/bin/netcomics -D -w

=item 3.
Grab Dilbert & Foxtrot comics from the past 30 days, place them in /tmp,
and create a web page with a specific title (<DATE> gets replaced with the
name of the month).

   netcomics -c "dilbert ft" -n 30 -d /tmp -w -wt 'Dilbert & \
   Foxtrot Comics From the Month of <DATE FORMAT="%b">'

=item 4.
Specify the date range of comics to retrieve to be from Feb 3, 1999
to Feb 6, 1999, and also get comics on March 3, 1998.

   netcomics -S 2-3-99 -E 2-6-99 -T 3-3-98

=item 5.
Specify the date range of comics to retrieve to be from Jan 6, 1999
and the 5 days before it.  Get all the comics except Jerkcity and Doodie

   netcomics -E 1-6-99 -n 6 -C jc -C doodie

=item 6.
Specify the date range of comics to retrieve to be all those that came
available three, four, and five days ago.

   netcomics -N 3 -n 3

=item 7.
Specify the date range of comics to retrieve to be all those that are
dated three, four, and five days ago.  This example is given to show
the difference between -E & -S  (when given a number) and -N. All
comics downloaded will have the same 3 dates, while in the previous 
example, the comics will have varying dates that are determined by
the 3rd column in the output of -l. Note that since many comics aren't
available until 2 weeks have past, many of them will not download
with this example.

   netcomics -E 3 -n 3

            or

   netcomics -E 3 -S 5

=item 8.
Use wget instead of libwww-perl (makes it so you don't have to install
libwww-perl).

   netcomics -g

=item 9.
Do not actually download the comics, and output the webpage to stdout.

   netcomics -uwo

=item
Some of the comics depend on having the LANG and/or LC_CTYPE set so that
the abbreviated month names are of only a certain locale.   Therefore,
these comics will not download for certain locals.

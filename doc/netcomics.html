DESCRIPTION</A>
</H1>
The <EM>netcomics</EM> program will download today's comic strips from
the Web, and place them in a spool directory where they can be
retrieved for display.  Because each website that carries comic
strips chooses how old of strips to show, the comic strips downloaded
will actually be from different dates.  Most common will be comic
strips that are 1 week, 2 weeks, and 3 weeks old. Also, each website
is not updated at the same time, nor are any of them updated at a
consistent time during the day.  Therefore, when running netcomics
as a cron job in the early morning, you may need to rerun it by hand
a little later in the day to get the comics that it couldn't find.
The exact command to run is given at the end of <EM>netcomics</EM> output
if any failures occurred.
<p><EM>netcomics</EM> also supports retrieving specific dates of comics.  A
``Starting Date'' may be specified with 
<A HREF="doc/netcomics.html#doc/netcomics_s_1">-S</A>
.  An ``Ending Date'' may be
specified with 
<A HREF="doc/netcomics.html#doc/netcomics_e_0">-E</A>
.  And a specific date may be specified with

<A HREF="doc/netcomics.html#doc/netcomics_t_1">-T</A>
.  All dates are given in the M-D-[YY]YY format.  If a start date
is given without an end date, 
<A HREF="doc/netcomics.html#doc/netcomics_n_0">-n</A>
 may be used to specify the number
of days of comics to retrieve starting at the specified start date.
If an end date is given without a start date, 
<A HREF="doc/netcomics.html#doc/netcomics_n_0">-n</A>
 will specify the
number of days of comics to retrieve counting backwards from the end
date.  If a start date is given without 
<A HREF="doc/netcomics.html#doc/netcomics_n_0">-n</A>
 or 
<A HREF="doc/netcomics.html#doc/netcomics_e_0">-E</A>
, then the end
date is assumed to be today's date.  If the option given to 
<A HREF="doc/netcomics.html#doc/netcomics_e_0">-E</A>
,

<A HREF="doc/netcomics.html#doc/netcomics_s_1">-S</A>
, or 
<A HREF="doc/netcomics.html#doc/netcomics_t_1">-T</A>
 is just an integer, that integer is interpreted as
the number of days prior to the current day (specify specific dates
relatively).
<p>Another way to specify the dates to download comics, is to use 
<A HREF="doc/netcomics.html#doc/netcomics_n_1">-N</A>

in conjunction with 
<A HREF="doc/netcomics.html#doc/netcomics_n_0">-n</A>
.  The argument to 
<A HREF="doc/netcomics.html#doc/netcomics_n_1">-N</A>
 is the number of
days prior to the current day to retrieve comics.  Note that this does
not specify an actual date.  It rather indicates the number of days
ago a comic was made available, rather than the actual date of the
comic.  To see how far behind the date of each comic is from the date
it actually gets released, use 
<A HREF="doc/netcomics.html#doc/netcomics_l_0">-l</A>
.  So if today is Wednesday, and you
specify 
<A HREF="doc/netcomics.html#doc/netcomics_n_1">-N 2</A>
, <EM>netcomics</EM> will download the comics that were made
available on Monday.  This is useful for running netcomics in a
timezone that is way ahead of the timezones the comics' websites are
located.
<p><EM>netcomics</EM> was created for the purpose of giving your weary mind a 
little relief from your hectic workday, so another script
called <EM>show_comics</EM> has been provided to periodically popup the 
retrieved comic strips throughout the workday.  Another script called
<EM>display_comics</EM> has also been provided, but it is only an example
script of what can be done for displaying comics on many users
computers on a network.
<p><STRONG>Important:</STRONG>  The further east your timezone is from the US, the later 
in the day you'll have to run <EM>netcomics</EM>.  As a reference, I suggest
those whose timezone in GMT to wait to run the script at 12:30pm if
they want to get all the comics at a time that's pretty likely to have
had all of the websites updated.  Use 
<A HREF="doc/netcomics.html#doc/netcomics_n_1">-N</A>
 if you want to run the
script early in the morning and are having problems getting comics to
download. Also, just because a comic failed to download doesn't mean
that the module for that comic is broken--it most likely the website
just hasn't been updated yet.
<p><EM>netcomics</EM> can also create an HTML file, ``index.html'', in the
directory you have the comics placed.   If a number is given with

<A HREF="doc/netcomics.html#doc/netcomics_w_1">-W</A>
 or 
<A HREF="doc/netcomics.html#doc/netcomics_w_0">-w</A>
, it will be used to determine the number of comics to
be placed in each html file.  Subsequent files are named ``comic#.html''.
<p><STRONG>Disclaimer:</STRONG> Do not put the comics up on the Internet!  You should
only use them for your own use.  Also, do not redistribute the comics
downloaded by <EM>netcomics</EM> in any other way unless you receive written
authorization from each publisher.

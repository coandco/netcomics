<H2>How to Personalize the Created Web Page</H2>
The web page is created from a perl module in the namespace Netcomics::HTML::Themes.
Don't know what that means? Copy the following template:<br>
<PRE>
package Netcomics::HTML::Themes::Default;
sub new {
	my $class = shift;

my $HTML_HEAD = <<'END_HEAD';

END_HEAD

my $HTML_LINKS = <<'END_LINKS';

END_LINKS

my $HTML_BODY = <<'END_BODY';

END_BODY

my $HTML_BODY_ELEMENT = <<'END_BODY_ELEMENT';

END_BODY_ELEMENT

my $HTML_TAIL = <<'END_TAIL';

END_TAIL

my $HTML_LINKS_INDEX = <<'END_LINKS_INDEX';

END_LINKS_INDEX

my $HTML_INDEX_ELEMENT = <<'END_INDEX_ELEMENT';

END_INDEX_ELEMENT

	my $self = {
		'head' => $HTML_HEAD,
		'links' => $HTML_LINKS,
		'body' => $HTML_BODY,
		'body_el' => $HTML_BODY_ELEMENT,
		'tail' => $HTML_TAIL,
		'links_index' => $HTML_LINKS_INDEX,
		'index_element' => $HTML_INDEX_ELEMENT,
	};

	return bless $self, $class;
}

</PRE>
<P>The webpage is divided into 7 parts:</P>
<UL>
  <LI><I>$HTML_HEAD</I>:
      <UL>
	<LI>The string <B>"&lt;DATE&gt;"</B> is replaced with
	    the date of the form "mon day, Year"  This can be changed
	    using the -wf option ($webpage_datefmt in the rc file).</LI>
	<LI>If &lt;DATE&gt; is provided with the optional attribute,
	    <B>FORMAT=""</B>, the text between the quotes is used
	    as the format specifier for the POSIX::strftime() function.
	    The whole &lt;DATE FORMAT=""&gt; is replaced with the
	    string produced by strftime().  Escaped double quotes are
	    not allowed between the quotes. See the man page for
	    strftime() on your system.</LI>
      </UL>
  </LI>
      
  <LI><I>$HTML_BODY_ELEMENT</I>:
      <UL>
	<LI><B>"&lt;COMIC_FILE#&gt;"</B> is replaced with the filename of
	    the comic.</LI>
	<LI><B>"&lt;SIZE&gt;"</B> is replaced with the HTML
	    &lt;IMG&gt; attributes HEIGHT=# and WEIGHT=#.  This will
	    help make rendering the web page happen more quickly in
	    most browsers.</LI>
      </UL>
  </LI>
  <LI><I>$HTML_TAIL</I>: The string <B>"&lt;CTIME&gt;"</B> is replaced with
      the date as returned by POSIX::ctime().
  </LI>
  <LI><I>$HTML_LINKS</I>:
      <UL>
	<LI><B>"&lt;FILE=PREV&gt;"</B> is replaced with the filename
	    of the previous webpage file.</LI>
	<LI><B>"&lt;FILE=NEXT&gt;"</B> is replaced with the filename
	    of the next webpage file.</LI>
      </UL>
  </LI>
  <LI><I>$HTML_LINKS_INDEX</I>: Both of the file types in links.html
      are also replaced in this one, plus <B>"&lt;FILE=NEXT&gt;"</B>
      which is replaced with the filename of the next webpage
      index. This template is used instead of links.html if an index
      is created (by default).
  </LI>
  <LI><I>$HTML_INDEX_ELEMENT</I>: When created, an index webpage is
      constructed using head.html, an instance of this template for
      each comic, and tail.html. 
      <UL>
	<LI><B>"&lt;FILE=CURRENT&gt;"</B> is replaced with the
	    name of the webpage in which the comic is included.</LI>
	<LI><B>"&lt;COMIC_ID&gt;"</B> is replaced with the id of the
	    comic so that it can be uniquely hyperlinked to (the date
	    is also attached to the id).</LI>
	<LI><B>"&lt;COMIC_DATE&gt;"</B> is replaced with the date of
	    the comic.</LI>
	<LI><B>"&lt;COMIC_NAME&gt;"</B> is replaced with the name of
	    the comic.</LI>
	<LI><B>"&lt;COMIC_AUTHOR&gt;"</B> is replaced with author of
	    the comic.</LI>
	<LI><B>"&lt;COMIC_STATUS&gt;"</B> is replaced with the status
	    of the comic. If it a local file, "local"; if it is a URL,
	    "remote".</LI>
	<LI><B>"&lt;PAGE=CURRENT&gt;"</B> is replaced with number of
	    the webpage in which the comic is included.</LI>
      </UL>
  </LI>
</UL>

<H2>How to Personalize the Created Web Page (Old Style, pre-0.14 release)</H2>
<P>The web page is created from three template files:  a head (contains
more than just the html head section): <I>head.html</I>, a body
element: <I>body_el#.html</I>, and a tail: <I>tail.html</I>. The head &
tail are used once, and the body element is repeated for each comic
strip.  The files are installed by default under
<I>/usr/share/netcomics/html_tmpl/</I>.</P>

<P>There are multiple body_el#.html files.  The number indicates
the number of image files in a comic that template handles.  For
example, some comic strips provide each panel on Sunday in a seperate
file.  If there are 5 frames total, then body_el5.html will be used.
Inside it are 5 places for the file names to be inserted. (Yes, I
don't like this design, but it was quick.  At some point, I'll change
it so that there's 2 templates for the body elements--a template
wrapper around a set of file element templates, and a file element
template.)</P>

<P>Since you are allowed to specify a different directory to contain
these files with the <B>-m</B> option, if you do use that option, you
must create a set of template html files, or the web page will not be 
created when using the <B>-w</B> or <B>-W</B> options.  I suggest
copying the template files and modifying them instead of starting from
scratch.

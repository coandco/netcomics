<H2>How to Personalize the Created Web Page</H2>
The web page is created from a perl module in the namespace
Netcomics::HTML::Themes. Copy the following template:<br>
<PRE>

package Netcomics::HTML::Themes::ThemeName;
use vars '@ISA'; @ISA = ("Netcomics::HTML::Themes::Default");
use strict;

my (%html,%imgs);

sub new {
    my $class = shift;
    return $class->SUPER::new("Theme Name",\%imgs,\%html);
}

1;
</PRE>
<P>Then for each part of the default theme you want to change, copy it
from the Default.pm theme file into yours and modify it.  If you don't
want to use any of the Default theme, then make your's ISA line be
"Netcomics::HTML::Theme".</P>

<P>To make a theme with images, use the mktheme script in the contrib
directory (or doc directory if installed from an rpm) to produce the
perl code from a set of images.  To get the actual images out of their
mime-encoded form, use the theme to create a set of html pages, and it
will place them in a subdirectory ".theme".  See the CleanRound theme
for an example. Note that you can name the image files whatever you
want--and they don't even have to be images either.</P>

<P>The html hash has 10 keys, each of which is refered to in here as a
"section":</P>
<UL>
  <LI><I>head</I>:
      <UL>
	<LI>The string <B>&lt;DATE&gt;</B> is replaced with
	    the date of the form "mon day, Year".  This can be changed
	    using the -wf option ($webpage_datefmt in the rc file).
	    This can be used in any section, though.
	</LI>
	<LI>If &lt;DATE&gt; is provided with the optional attribute,
	    <B>FORMAT=""</B>, the text between the quotes is used
	    as the format specifier for the POSIX::strftime() function.
	    The whole &lt;DATE FORMAT=""&gt; is replaced with the
	    string produced by strftime().  Escaped double quotes are
	    not allowed between the quotes. See the man page for
	    strftime() on your system.</LI>
	<li><B>&lt;PAGETITLE&gt;</B>: title of the page.  This can be
	    used in any section, though.
	</li>
	<li><B>&lt;CTIME&gt;</B>: time at which the page is created.
	    Can be used in any section.
	</li>
	<li><B>&lt;THEME_DIR&gt;</B>: location where the theme images
	    are placed. This can be used in any section.
	</li>
	<li><B>&lt;NUM=FIRST&gt;</B>: Number of the first comic in the
	    page of the whole set.
	</li>
	<li><B>&lt;NUM=LAST&gt;</B>: Number of the last comics in the page.
	</li>
	<li><B>&lt;NUM=TOTAL&gt;</B>: Total number of comics in the
	    whole set.
	</li>
	<li><B>&lt;LINK_COLOR&gt;</B>: User's selection of the color
	    applied to unvisited links.
	</li>
	<li><B>&lt;VLINK_COLOR&gt;</B>: User's selection of the color
	    applied to visited links. 
	</li>
	<li><B>&lt;BACKGROUND&gt;</B>: User's selection for the
	    background attribute for the page.
	</li>
      </UL>
  </LI>
      
  <li><i>links</i>: provides the links for going forward &
      backward through a set of pages.  Used when the page has no
      corresponding index page (in index pages themselves & in the
      comic pages when the user has selected to not have an index
      created).
      <ul>
	<LI><B>&lt;FILE=PREV&gt;</B> is replaced with the filename
	    of the previous webpage file.</LI>
	<LI><B>&lt;FILE=NEXT&gt;</B> is replaced with the filename
	    of the next webpage file.</LI>
	<li><B>&lt;NUM&gt;</b> is replaced with the number of comics
	    per page.</li>
      </ul>
  </li>

  <LI><I>links_index</I>: Both of the file types in <i>links</i>
      are also replaced in this one, plus <B>&lt;FILE=INDEX&gt;</B>
      which is replaced with the filename of the page's corresponding
      index page. This template is used instead of <i>links</i> if an
      index is created (by default).
  </LI>

  <li><i>pre_body</i>: include anything you want between the head and
      the body.  This is usually the start of a TABLE.
  </li>

    <li><i>body</i>: A body is used to contain a single comic, so this
	is typically a table row.
      <ul>
	<li>
	<LI><B>&lt;COMIC_ID&gt;</B> is replaced with the id of the
	    comic so that it can be uniquely hyperlinked to (the date
	    is also attached to the id).</LI>
	<LI><B>&lt;COMIC_NAME&gt;</B> is replaced with the name of
	    the comic.</LI>
	<LI><B>&lt;ELEMENT&gt;</B> is replaced with 1 to n <i>body_el</i>
	    sections.  A <i>body_el</i> section is used for each image that
	    makes up the comic.</LI>
	<LI><B>&lt;CAPTION&gt;</B> is replaced with the <i>caption</i>
	    section or a blank string if the comic doesn't have a
	    caption.</LI>
	<LI><B>&lt;WIDTH&gt;</B> is replaced with the HTML
	    &lt;IMG&gt; attribute WIDTH=#.  This is needed for theming
	    with images used to frame the comic.  Although not a
	    perfect way of determining the width for multi-file
	    comics, width is that of the widest image in the
	    set that makes up the comic.
	</LI>
	<LI><B>&lt;HEIGHT&gt;</B> is replaced with the HTML
	    &lt;IMG&gt; attribute HEIGHT=#.  This is needed for theming
	    with images used to frame the comic.  Although not a
	    perfect way of determining the height for multi-file
	    comics, height is the sum of the heights of all the images
	    that make up the comic.
	</LI>
	</li>
      </ul>
  </li>

  <LI><I>body_el</I>:
      <UL>
	<LI><B>&lt;COMIC_FILE#&gt;</B> is replaced with the filename of
	    the comic.</LI>
	<LI><B>&lt;SIZE&gt;</B> is replaced with the HTML
	    &lt;IMG&gt; attributes HEIGHT=# and WIDTH=#.  This
	    make rendering the web page happen more quickly in
	    most browsers.</LI>
      </UL>
  </LI>

    <li><i>caption</i>:
      <ul>
	<li><B>&lt;CAPTION_DATA&gt;</B>: replaced with the comic's
	    caption data.
	</li>
      </ul>
  </li>

  <LI><I>tail</I>: The string <B>&lt;CTIME&gt;</B> is replaced with
      the date as returned by POSIX::ctime().
  </LI>

  <LI><I>index_element</I>: When created, an index webpage is
      constructed using <i>head</i>, an instance of this template for
      each comic, and <i>tail</i>. 
      <UL>
	<LI><B>&lt;FILE=CURRENT&gt;</B> is replaced with the
	    name of the webpage in which the comic is included.</LI>
	<LI><B>&lt;COMIC_ID&gt;</B> is replaced with the id of the
	    comic so that it can be uniquely hyperlinked to (the date
	    is also attached to the id).</LI>
	<LI><B>&lt;COMIC_DATE&gt;</B> is replaced with the date of
	    the comic.</LI>
	<LI><B>&lt;COMIC_NAME&gt;</B> is replaced with the name of
	    the comic.</LI>
	<LI><B>&lt;COMIC_AUTHOR&gt;</B> is replaced with author of
	    the comic.</LI>
	<LI><B>&lt;COMIC_STATUS&gt;</B> is replaced with the status
	    of the comic. If it a local file, "local"; if it is a URL,
	    "remote".</LI>
	<LI><B>&lt;PAGE=CURRENT&gt;</B> is replaced with number of
	    the webpage in which the comic is included.</LI>
      </UL>
  </LI>
</UL>

<H2>How to Personalize the Created Web Page (Old Style, pre-0.14 release)</H2>
<P>The web page is created from three template files:  a head (contains
more than just the html head section): <I>head.html</I>, a body
element: <I>body_el#.html</I>, and a tail: <I>tail.html</I>. The head &
tail are used once, and the body element is repeated for each comic
strip.  The files are installed by default under
<I>/usr/share/netcomics/html_tmpl/</I>.</P>

<P>There are multiple body_el#.html files.  The number indicates
the number of image files in a comic that template handles.  For
example, some comic strips provide each panel on Sunday in a seperate
file.  If there are 5 frames total, then body_el5.html will be used.
Inside it are 5 places for the file names to be inserted. (Yes, I
don't like this design, but it was quick.  At some point, I'll change
it so that there's 2 templates for the body elements--a template
wrapper around a set of file element templates, and a file element
template.)</P>

<P>Since you are allowed to specify a different directory to contain
these files with the <B>-m</B> option, if you do use that option, you
must create a set of template html files, or the web page will not be 
created when using the <B>-w</B> or <B>-W</B> options.  I suggest
copying the template files and modifying them instead of starting from
scratch.
</P>

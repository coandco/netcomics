	indicator line to not restrict the major mode of perl or cperl.

	that works...

	$self->{'hof'} here, so duplication of work is minimalized == faster
	startups.

	Factory.pm.

	* Netcomics/GtkComics.pm: Small tweaks to the List widget.
	* gtkcomics: gtkcomic's list of comics no longer has ${proc} on

	the days behind either...

	the rules for producing man & html pages.

	declared "binaries"
	* debian/rules: We now use dh_installman to install the man pages
	instead of doing it man-ually. (pun intended.) Changed "make clean"
	to "make distclean" so each time a Debian package is built, it starts
	from scratch.

	(get_comics): Moved where the subdirectory is created when
	separate_comics is selected to after it's been determined if the

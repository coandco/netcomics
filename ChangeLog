	* Makefile (AP4NAME): Changed to gtkcomics
	* netcomics, gtkcomics, Netcomics/*: Removed Perl from emacs mode
	indicator line to not restrict the major mode of perl or cperl.

	that works...

	Factory.pm. 
	* Netcomics/Config.pm.in (clear_date_settings): added function that

2001-05-06  Elliot Glaysher  <nuriko.chan@home.com>

	* Netcomics/GtkComics.pm: Small tweaks to the List widget.
	* gtkcomics: gtkcomic's list of comics no longer has ${proc} on

	the days behind either...

	the rules for producing man & html pages.

	* debian/rules: We now use dh_installman to install the man pages
	instead of doing it man-ually. (pun intended.) Changed "make clean"

	(get_comics): Moved where the subdirectory is created when
	separate_comics is selected to after it's been determined if the

Netcomics is a perl script that can retrieve comic strips from the Web
that are continuously being updated each day.  Netcomics utilizes a
modular set of library perl scripts that provide it information on
where to find each specific comic strip.  It is most often run as a
cron job, along with display_comics or show_comics.

In order to download comics from the Internet, you will need to either
have the appropriate Perl modules, or a command-line program that can
do it.  A commonly used command-line URL fetcher is wget.

If you don't have a command-line program that can retrieve URL's,
then to run netcomics, the following CSPAN perl modules are required:
HTML-Parser, libwww-perl, URI, MIME-Base64, and MD5.  You can retrieve
these as rpms or as sources from the netcomics hompage.  See the
manpage for CPAN for help on a way to automatically download these
modules, or goto http://cpan.perl.org/, or get the rpms from the
netcomics homepage (see below). To use the show_comics script, you'll
also need to have perlTk installed. 

See INSTALL for instructions on how to setup netcomics.

See the manpage for netcomics for information on how to use it.
doc/netcomics.html is an HTML version of the manpage.

See the doc/Comic_Modules-HOWTO.html file to learn how to add your
own comics modules.  See doc/Modify_Webpage_Creation-HOWTO.html
for how to personalize the webpages that can be created with the
-w & -W options.

This program does not have to be specific to just comic strips.  If
you have an idea on how it could be implemented more generally for
other applications, please let me know.  My unimplemented modules are
available in the source tree under lib/disabled.  So before making
additions, be sure to download the source or the SRPM if you've
installed this from an rpm.

Send email to myself, Ben Hochstedler <hochstrb@cs.rose-hulman.edu>,
or contact me by ICQ: 15469308 if you wish to submit your own netcomics 
lib modules for addition in the next release, or to request a specific 
comic you know the website at which it exists to be added.  Of course, 
bug reports and suggested enhancements are always welcome.

Make sure you include the version of netcomics you are running when
sending me a bug report!
